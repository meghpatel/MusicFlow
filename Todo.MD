[ ] A file of workflow that can detect the changes to raw data folder i.e. Apple Music Activity and run scripts to extract all zip files and do preprocessing and update database or anything
[ ] Create a UI to visualize/view data. Create a locally runnable
[ ] For MD files do a better render of dates no matter how it is stored in DB.
[ ] Check if any better way of creating data schema and stuff up to date?
[ ] What AI and non-Ai optimization tools can be used?
[ ] Data would be requested every week or so, come up with better data versioning system.
Ideally, it should be capable of doing this
[ ] Between data of November 2024 and June 2025, they updated schema from 125 columns to 134. Be prepared for schema/data changes

1. Automatically detects new data when pasted in a folder
2. Triggers a pipeline that will extract the data, move to right folders
3. Now, the dataset is explored and ready to sent to DB.
4. Choose a DB SQL or NoSQL which is better, RDBMS or other?
5. Dataset should be able to be updated, Also some versioning system that makes the change in data just like git.

This is beginner level
[ ] I have explored many files now, so as soon as EDA is done, make them query ready. Maybe in a DB or someway I can access it for current analysis
